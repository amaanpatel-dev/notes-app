# Notes App

A simple **Notes App** built with HTML, CSS (using Tailwind), and JavaScript. The app allows users to create, edit, and delete notes, with all data being persistently stored in the browser's local storage. This ensures that notes remain available even after a page reload.

## Features

### 1. Create Notes
- Click on the "Create Note" button to add a new editable note.
- Each note is created dynamically and contains a contenteditable text area.

### 2. Edit Notes
- Notes are fully editable; users can click on the text area and type or modify content as needed.

### 3. Delete Notes
- Each note has a delete icon.
- Clicking on the delete icon removes the note from the DOM and updates local storage accordingly.

### 4. Persistent Storage
- Notes are stored in the browser's `localStorage`.
- On page reload, stored notes are automatically loaded back into the app.

### 5. Auto-Cleanup of Empty Notes
- If a user erases all content in a note, it is automatically removed from the app and `localStorage`.
